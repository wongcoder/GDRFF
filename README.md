# GDRFF

The current front-end section for General Dynamics. Shouldn't work by itself--it requires an API. You can make the API yourself, and change the servername. Just make sure you follow the route that I call in the post request. 

There are no coding standards and the code is messy. I wrote this in about one day to demo for General Dynamics. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

(I don't make lint errors by the way)
